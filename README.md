# FEAT: Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport




ðŸš§ Under construction and coming soon:
- instruction for environment installation


### Data preparation

Please put the data in ```data/``` folder.


### Run FEAT

```
python main_train.py --config gmm_si > log.txt
```

hyparameters can be set in ```config/defaults/xxx.yaml```.



### Env

Our code is implemented in ```pytorch```. After preparing the environment with torch, please also install openmm and other dependencies

```
conda install -c conda-forge openmm openmmtools
pip install normflows
pip install git+https://github.com/VincentStimper/boltzmann-generators.git
```
and install bgflow at [https://github.com/noegroup/bgflow](https://github.com/noegroup/bgflow).

For experiments with OT plan, please install ```torchcfm``` package via

```
pip install torchcfm
```
